# The-L-Game
I am looking to make the strategic but simple game known as "The L Game" have online multiplayer capabilities. Like being able to play against a friend... There's a version on the internet here:  https://hwwmath.looiwenli.com/l-game but it's only "you vs a computer" or "you vs person" but said person has to physically be beside you. How could I make this like a online multiplayer?
